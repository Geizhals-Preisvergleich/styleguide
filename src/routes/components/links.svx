# Links

**TODO**: Define the rules for when to use which kind of link!

## Regular Link

This is the most basic type of links. Blue, underlined, no hover style. Nothin' fancy, but it is there for you when you need it.

<LinkRegular>I am a link. I am blue and underlined.</LinkRegular>

### without underline

Regular links are also frequently used without underlines. This is also the preferred style for linked text with larger font size, like product names in [Listview](views/listview) or [Galleryview](views/galleryview).

<LinkRegular noUnderline>
  I am a link too, but I not underlined â€“ except for when you hover over me.
</LinkRegular>

### grey, without underline

Grey links use the text color grey-base and grey-darker-20 for hover.

<LinkRegular grey>I am a grey link and also only show underlines on hover.</LinkRegular>
