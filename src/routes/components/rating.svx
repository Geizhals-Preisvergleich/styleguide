# Rating

The Rating component is to communicate two kinds of ratings:
- Rating of the product
- Rating of the merchant ("HÃ¤ndler")

The Rating component consists of a visualisation of the rating (i.e. stars icons, filled proportionally from 1 to 5 stars) as well as a text label with the rating value and amount of ratings.
