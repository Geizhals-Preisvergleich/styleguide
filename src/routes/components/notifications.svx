# Notifications

Notifications are shown to inform users if a certain action was successful when otherwise the result would not be immediately visible. They are especially useful for asynchronous actions.

Notifications:

- are shown in the top right corner of the screen
- feature some text and an icon depending on the type of notification.
- will disappear after 3.8 seconds (can be configured)
- except for when hovering over the Notification ([_try it below!_](#types-of-notifications))
- can always be closed using the X-button
- can stack up to 5 Notifications at a time, whereas the newest Notification is at the top
- support swipe-to-dismiss on mobile
- support (limited) markdown syntax (bold, italic, links)

## Types of Notifications

There are currently three types of notifications:

Info:
<Notification
  type="info"
  message="I am an info notification! I can contain <strong>bold text too!</strong>"
/>

Success:
<Notification
  type="success"
  message="I am a success notification! I can contain <strong>bold text too!</strong>"
/>

Error:
<Notification
  type="error"
  message="I am an error notification! I can contain <strong>bold text too!</strong>"
/>
