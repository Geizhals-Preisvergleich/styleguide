# Card

Groups of UI elements which belong to the same functionality can be grouped in so-called Cards. This helps to understand the relation between UI elements and seperates areas of the UI in distinctive groups.

## Modern Cards

Currently, Cards are displayed as a box with a border of "grey-lighter-40" (see <a href="/design/colors/#grey-variations">Colors</a>), white background and padding of 1rem:

```css
.mycard {
  background: #fff;
  border: 1px solid @grey-lighter-40;
  padding: 1rem;
}
```

This type of card is used on these pages, among others:

- Search Results (SERP)
- Deals
- Variant
- Product Ratings
